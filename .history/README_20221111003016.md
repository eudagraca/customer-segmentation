# Customer Segmentation 
<p>Customer segmentation according to the revenue|spend they made within the network</p>
<i>We have two different segmentation prespectives (Behavioral and Marketing)</i>

#### Marketing segmentation
<p>Is the practice of dividing your target market into approachable groups</p>

#### Behavioral segmentation
<p>refers to a process in marketing which divides customers into segments depending on their behavior patterns when interacting with a particular business or website.</p>

# Installation and Usage

`npm i customer-segmentation --save`
<br></br>
```
const { customerSegment } = require("customer-segmentation");
const behavior = customerSegment({ name: "John Doe", revenue: 2500, age: 30 });

# Result

  name: 'John Doe',
  revenue: 834,
  city: undefined,
  networkOperator: undefined,
  age: 30,
  behaviorSegmentation: 'H',
  marketSegmentation: 'MASS MARKET'
